Codes for 40-channel EEG acquisition device, stm32h743iit6_ads1299_virtual_serial_port.

The experimental code presented herein is developed within the CubeMX and Visual Studio (STM32 for VSCode) development environments. It utilizes the ADS1299 chip for the acquisition of electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, with the STM32H743IIT6 serving as the primary control unit. High-speed USB communication with the host is established through the USB3300. This project is exploratory in nature and will undergo further expansion and updates. In addition to its data acquisition capabilities, the code also incorporates preliminary features such as chip error reporting, device performance testing, and other functionalities.
